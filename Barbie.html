<p>Barbie Logo goes here</p>

  <p>Barbie has been around since 1959 and took the Turtle Islands by storm, by both fans and haters, and thanks to many dedicated historians, we know when she landed in Keo Deudai she had both a similar reaction but also had a unique reaction to this land. She landed here in 1961, and unlike most doll lines we witness today, she’s never had an official reboot. <p>
<p>She’s evolved with the times, resulting in different eras with the only exception being the 2015 event with the introduction of new body types, a new production process and the introduction of numbered fashionistas.<p>
