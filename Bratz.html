<h3>Generation 3</h3>

<h2>2015</h2>

<h2>2016</h2>

<p>After the G3 Bratz reboot failed, the brand took a tempoarary hiatus, only releasing 1 doll line during a 3 year period. Many fans explain this as MGA attempting to 'apologise' for the abhorrent 2015 reboot.</p>

<h2>2018</h2>

<p>Another break, with only merchandise being produced during this time but in March, 2020, the brand was revived for it's 20th anniversary but no dolls were made until 2021.</p>
