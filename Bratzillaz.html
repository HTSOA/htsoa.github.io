<p>After the popularity of Monster High blew up, MGA followed a long established tradition of making their own version of their rivals dolls. They came up with Bratzillaz, the witchy cousins of the Bratz.</p>
<p>While loved by many fans of the gothic and edgy when released, it did not last as long as their rival Monster High. Bratzillaz has since gained a cult following after their released and while MGA's social media has brought them up since,</p>
<p>It is very unlikely they will be rebooted or rereleased due to the current generation of Monster High's including witches in their new lore.</p>
