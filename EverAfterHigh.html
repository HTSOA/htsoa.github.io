<p>Ever After High was created as a sister brand to the original line of Monster High dolls, as instead of focusing on monsters and horror, focused on fairy tales and the children of well known fairy tales as it appealed to a different audience.</p>
<p>It stars Raven Queen, the daughter of the Evil Queen from the Snow White fairy tale and involves a whole cast of different fairy tales, most noticably is the opposite of the coin to the Snow White story, is Apple White, the daughter of Snow White.</p>
<p>The plot was the battle between following your destiny or rebelling against it in a prestigious high school setting, surviving high school while rediscovering history and that while the adults today say 'follow your destiny or bad things will happen.' actual history suggests otherwise.</p> 
<p>This is one of the only few lines that bring up such an important question, through the many talented workers at Mattel and shares the very core of what HTSOA stands for.</p>

<p>Cool Lore: Other fairy tales include Alice in Wonderland, Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid and many other stories were included but this lead to Mattel and Disney clashing; Disney had given the Disney license so that Mattel could make dolls but were chronically dissapointed with the quality Mattel released.</p>
<p>and now with this new fairy tale based franchise, Disney left Mattel to swap to Hasbro.</p>
<p>This lead to a major panic with the higher ups at Mattel, and along with a slump in sales because of doll fatigue (due to how many dolls that resonated with consumers being released.) The higher ups stuck with what they thought best  for both Ever After High and Monster High, by rebooting both franchises away from the designers visions and towards an idealized younger demographic.</p>
<p>This lead to EAH was soft rebooted with a simplified "princesses are powerful', these new items had reduced detail, was cheapened, and had a slower pace with weaker plot.</p>\
<p>That also meant Monster High's first generation also ended and rebotted as the babified and sanistised G2 which sold incredibly poorly before it was ended. This move killed both franchises and to the company, lost millions of dollars.</p>

<p>Cool Lore 2: Monster High has since been rebooted for the third time, known as G3, but Mattel is contractually obligated to never reboot EAH when they signed with Disney. Thus, it is considered a truly dead brand.</p>
