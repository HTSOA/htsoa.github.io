  <p>Happy Family Logo goes here</p>

<p>The Happy Family emerged from the Barbie line, starring Barbie's life long best friend Midge Hadley after she married Alan in 1991. They had followed the wishes of the elite by settling down and starting a family.</p>
<p>This line is where the now controversial pregnant Midge is from, and unlike the rumors suggesting that her recall was entirely because a pregnant doll was so uncomfortable and it would destroy society, it was mostly because the baby belly attachment had only semi secured magnets; making it a choking hazard.</p>
<p>There was some buzz because it was a first, but any controvery is minimal as this is disproven by a known competitior, Steffi Love, who still sells pregnant dolls to stores. This controversy does bring up great questions surrounding multiple aspects of western society.</p>

  <p>Cool Lore: This is where the issues with the magnets and the issues regarding a pregnant doll began, because they released two versions of each skin tone Midge & children. One with the prgenant stomach, and one without it. They even tried giving her a wedding ring to reduce the drama.</p>
