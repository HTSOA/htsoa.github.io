<p>Mermaze Mermaids was a line of mermaid dolls produced by MGA Entertainment at the same time as Spinmaster's Mermaid High, leading to rumors that they were meant to be a competitor to both Spin Master's new line and the Barbie mermaids.</p>
<p>It stars 6 mermaids who were chosen by a mentor figure named Orra, to gain new powers and face an immense challenge.</p>

<p>Due to a lukewarm launch and then a expensive second line, the line was put on an unofficial hiatus for a years where out of the blue, a UK exlcusive toy stores had gotten in some units of what was thought to be cancelled line.</p>
<p>It was speculated that Smyth's had been the only store to order the Slumber Party line before MGA quietly cancelled it, leading to them having to fulfill the orders and because of this, the line was severely cheapened.</p>
<p>Only a luck few were able to grab any when it was released, only restocked once after the initial line launched and then the same line again in Kruvidat a few years later.</p>
