<p>Monster High was pitched to Mattel by Garrett Sander, a gay man who was surrounded by equally dedicated co workers that brought the idea to life. </p>
<p>Since Bratz had come out and Mattel had faced their first real competitor ever along with the various lawsuits between the two companies, as well as the decline in Barbie sales it was the perfect time to pitch something nobody had ever seen and the higher ups, having no other choice to stay relevant at the peak of the Scene/Emo phase they trialled out these dolls and they were an instant hit; not just in the Turtle Islands but worldwide! </p>
<p>It starred the daughter of Frankenstein, Frankie Stein attending her first day of school at Monster High, a famous public school where they accepted every kind of monster which was revolutionary in their world. There she met Draculaura, the adopted daughter of Dracula and Clawdeen Wolf, a daughter of a werewolf; where they meet more monsters from all different backgrounds, go around having fantastic adventures and learn what being a monster is truly about. </p>

<p>Collectors Edition Draculaura confirmed to  not be sold here.</p>

  <p>Due to a decline in sales because of doll fatigue and Mattel loosing the Disney License in 2016, the higher ups went against Garrett Sanders original vision and the multitude of other workers objecting to the direction the bosses wanted to do, the Monster High line, or now known as G1, (Generation 1).</p>p> 
  <p>It had a reboot that turned down the edge and focused on a imagined younger and sanitised demographic known as G2 (Generation 2); this, in turn, killed Monster High faster.</p>

  <p>After it was cancelled for the 2nd time, Monster High went into 3 year hiatus before community love, fandom, persistence and passionate designers at Mattel lead to the surprise introduction of horror movie doll collabs.</p>
  <p>This was more of a test for Mattel to see if there was actually still demand for Monster High, and the designers were proven right as the first doll in the series, Pennywise sold out.</p>

<h2>2020</h2>
<p>Horror Movie Edition Pennywise from It Doll was not released here, sold exclusively through Mattel Creations.</p>
<p>Horror Movie Edition The Grady Twins from The Shining Dolls was not released here, sold exclusively through Mattel Creations.</p>

 <p>This lead to more horror movie dolls being released, and eventually, the 3rd reboot, known as Generation 3 (G3) which is the current generation in stores and on Netflix, was announced and launched.</p>

<h2>2021</h2>
<p>Horror Movie Edition Beetlejuice 2 Pack was not released here, sold exclusively through Mattel Creations.</p>
<p>Horror Movie Edition Greta Gremlin from the Gremlins Doll was not released here, sold exclusively through Mattel Creations.</p>

<p>G2 was launched to a less than stellar fanfare, fans felt betrayed and the new demographic didn't find it appealing as it wasn't ever intended for them.</p>
<p>It also does it now patented move of lower quality dolls, reduced articulation, and sanitised look. </p>
<p>The G2 reboot made Draculaura the main character, and set up a public school for every kind of monster to attend instead of attending a school with years of history behind it.</p>

<p>Monster High G2 was silently dropped, and along with it's sister series, EAH, both brands became abandoned. However, due to the love of the original brand, it's dedicated fanbase and dedicated workers; it rebooted once again.</p>
<p>The new generation, known as Generation 3 (G3) was offically announced after nearly a year of hints of Monster High's come back as well as a partial continuation of G1 as G1.5.</p>
<p>It now stars Clawdeen Wolf, a half human half werewolf child who after being constantly rejected by the human world, finds out she's a werwolf and with help of her father, finds her way to Monster High and joins Draculaura and Frankie in day to day life at school.</p>
<p>However, as the days go on, CLawdeen looks for her lost mother and discovers lost monster history along the way.</p>
