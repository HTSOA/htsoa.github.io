<p>Monster High was pitched to Mattel by Garrett Sander, a gay man who was surrounded by equally dedicated co workers that brought the idea to life. </p>
<p>Since Bratz had come out and Mattel had faced their first real competitor ever along with the various lawsuits between the two companies, as well as the decline in Barbie sales it was the perfect time to pitch something nobody had ever seen and the higher ups, having no other choice to stay relevant at the peak of the Scene/Emo phase they trialled out these dolls and they were an instant hit; not just in the Turtle Islands but worldwide! </p>
<p>It starred the daughter of Frankenstein, Frankie Stein attending her first day of school at Monster High, a famous public school where they accepted every kind of monster which was revolutionary in their world. There she met Draculaura, the adopted daughter of Dracula and Clawdeen Wolf, a daughter of a werewolf; where they meet more monsters from all different backgrounds, go around having fantastic adventures and learn what being a monster is truly about. </p>
