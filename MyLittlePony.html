  <p>My Little Pony began in 1981, with the My Pretty Pony created by Bonnie Zacherle for Hasbro.</p>
<p>The first official My Little Ponies began in 1982 in America and It is still uncertain if Australia followed suit or had it’s own unique schedule as UK exclusive ponies have shown up second hand repeatedly here. </p>
<p>Since it is the first iteration of the MLP, it is referred to as Generation 1, or G1. Each time it is rebooted, it moves onto a new generation. There are currently 5 gens of MLP.</p>
