  <h3>Generation 2</h3>
<p>Before the first reboot of MLP, known as G2 was released, Hasbro acquired Kenner and there was speculation that Kenner was making their own line of colourful horses to rival MLP.</p>
<p>However, when Hasbro acquired Kenner, they acquired this line and decided to use Kenner’s ip to launch the reboot of MLP.</p> 
<p>This line was a departure from what fans knew and thus, suffered from a lack of popularity. The line stopped being sold in America in 1999, and less places stocked this generation as the years went on, until the last place who ordered stock was France in 2003. </p>

<p>Founder’s note: Due to this lack of popularity, we don’t have much of a clue of how long it stayed in Australia but we do have physical proof that the last documented line was typed as ‘Secret Surprise III’ while showing a pic of Crystal from the first Princess Line in a catalouge. This suggests that G2 distribution here is different than the previously thought American timeline.</p>
<p>We have also witnessed multiple European exclusive’s pop up in second hand shops here, the latest we have seen is Copper Glow from the first Unicorn with Magic Wings and Dreamer or Dart from first line of Twins.</p>
<p>It might’ve stopped being sold in big box stores, but might’ve been sold for a longer time through Mr Toys Toysworld, Big W, independent toy stores or through discount stores.</p>

<p>The second reboot of MLP, known as G3 was launched, and Hasbro learnt from G2’s poor sales and returned to the more horselike designs.</p>
<p> When launched in 2003, it had a much stronger start than it’s predecessor and lasted for much longer.</p>
