<h3>Here, at the Historical Toy Society of Australia, we aim to do one thing.</h3>
<p>Our core mission is to preserve toy history through various means and tell history as it is, not what revisionists say it is.</p> 
<p>However, as a grassroots org that's only just starting we can't do everything we want to do.</p>
<p>We will do what we can at the moment; which is</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on getting our social media up to further our reach.</li>
<li>Search for lost physical media, search online for online resources and connect with community members who know history.</li>
<li>Begin to preserve physical media, archiving online media and start organising internal storage.</li>
<li>Continuously update the website with the latest discoveries and keep designing.</li>
</ul>
  
<h3>Our closer future plans</h3>
<p>We do plan, in the future doing:</p>
<ul>  
<li>Accepting donations of flawed and fixable toys and merch from people and charity shops to divert from landfill.</li>
<li>Restoring toys and toy related items, either to sell and raise funds for the society or redonate to second hand shops.</li> 
<li>Accept comissions to restore items and allow items to be reused for longer.</li>
<li>Start getting volunteers to help with every aspect of the society and help those who need community get connection.</li>
<li>Commission a First Nations artist to design aspects of the website, like background, aesthetic guide, etc.</li>
<li>Commission someone who is a minority website deisgner to help with development of the website.</li>
</ul>
  
<p>We do have many more plans for the society but we can't get ahead of ourselves as we already have a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>But here's a sneak peak</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting a 3D printer to print missing parts and to do repairs.</li>
<li>Start a replacement parts library.</li>
<li>Start gathering those small bits likely to be thrown out, like shoes, earrings and catalouge them, listing them for sale or free.</li>
</ul>
