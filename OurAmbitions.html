<p>Here, at the Historical Toy Society of Australia, we aim to do one thing. Our core mission is to preserve toy history through various means and tell history as it is, not what revisionists say it is.</p> 
<p>However, as a grassroots org that's only just starting we can't do everything we want to do.</p>
<p>We will do what we can at the moment, which is searching for lost physical media, search online for online resources and connect with community members who know history then updating information on this website.</p>
<p>We will also focus on getting our social media up to further our reach.</p>
<p>We will also begin to preserving physical media, archiving online media and start organising internal storage.</p>
  
<p>We do plan, in the future, on restoring toys plus toy related items so they don't go to landfill and selling or donating them.</p>
<p>We also plan various initatives in regards to this toy restoration, such as connecting with recycling plants, op shops and hoarding cleaners to rescue toys plus related items before they go to landfill.</p>
<p>As well as getting volunteers and hiring marginalized people for job oppertunities they couldn't get elsewhere.</p>

<p>We do have many more plans for the society but we can't get ahead of ourselves as we already have a lot of work to do.</p>
