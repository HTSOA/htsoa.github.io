<h2>Questions that we need to figure out.</h2>

  <p>What differenciates an action figure from a doll? Where do we draw the line?</p>
  <p>How often does a certain toy have to show up second hand to start considering the possibility it was sold here commercially and not brought through other means?</p>
  <p>If two toy lines are in the same universe, but are different lines (i.e. Rainbow High with Shadow High, He-Man with She-Ra, Barbie with MyScene, etc.) do we put them in the same listing, or do we list them as seperate entities?</p>
  <p>How do we track toys that are considered bootlegs with no official information out there? How would we organise them? Since they are toys sold by shops or sold to australia, we do have tp cover them but how?</p>

  <h2>Notice we're missing some history you know?</h2>
