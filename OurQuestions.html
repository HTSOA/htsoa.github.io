<h2>Questions that we need to figure out.</h2>

  <p>What differenciates an action figure from a doll? Where do we draw the line?</p>
  <p>How often does a certain toy have to show up second hand to start considering the possibility it was sold here commercially and not brought through other means?</p>
  <p>If two toy lines are in the same universe, but are different lines (i.e. Rainbow High with Shadow High, He-Man with She-Ra, Barbie with MyScene, etc.) do we put them in the same listing, or do we list them as seperate entities?</p>
