<p>Before Rainbow High launched, the predecessor Poopsie Surprise released what would lead into the Rainbow High we know today, a large assortment of 4 colourful toddler dolls, decked out with current fashion. The Rainbow High dolls were leaked at the 2020 Toy Fair.</p>
<p>Rainbow High was then launched in 2020, during the Doll Dark Age where the only fashion dolls available on store shelves were Barbie thus, this brand leading to the doll renaissance and the abundance of doll brands we see today.</p>
<p>It took MGA Entertainment a year after they were first sold in USA to be sold here in stores (WA has different schedules compared to QLD). They have somewhat maintained quicker shipments for Aus but have been dropping entire releases since the reboot.</p>
<p>It focuses on 6 teenagers entering a prestigious art high school and their advnetures, focusing on high fashion, luxury brands, fashion and most importantly, a grounded poltline that everyone could enjoy before the reboot.</p>
<p>However, the reboot has dropped alomst everything it once was. It is now aimed at toddlers, dropped the high fashion, focusing on high fantasy elements with that awkward pacing mreant for toddlers.</p>
