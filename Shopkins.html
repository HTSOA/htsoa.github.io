  <h2>Shokins</h2>
  <p>Shopkins intiially started as minatures with a signature style face and they were based off grocery store items, such as food, cleaning products, etc and they were developed by Moose, an Australian company, to be launched internationally to much hype and fanfare. 
  <p>As their initial populaity grew, they expanded to other items such as furniture, clothing, etc as the brand continued.</p>

  <p>Shopkins intially launched in 2014, after the workers at Moose noticed that their Trash Pack toys was sucessful among 'boys' but were lacking a dedicated line for 'girls'.</p>
  <p>This changed when Jacqui Tobias, the parent of a Moose employee, suggested the concept for Shopkins.</p>

  <h2>Shopkins Shoppies</h2>
  <p>Somewhere down the line of Shopkins popularity, the workers at Moose decided they wanted to try fashion dolls and they released the first Shopkins dolls to test the waters; aptly naming them Shoppies and based them around food./p>
  <p>They sold well, so they continued to release them until 2020 where the original line discontinued, and the higher ups at Moose decided to aim at a certain age demographic because 'there isn't a lot of toys aimed at that age group' and produced Kindi Kids.</p>
