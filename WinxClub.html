<p>Winx Club was released in 2004, and the dolls made by Mattel were released in store as Season 1 was being shown on ToastedTv during the weekday mornings. The version we got was dubbed by the now infamous 4Kids company.</p> 
<p>It stars Bloom, a teenager on Earth who discovers she's not a human, but a fairy and attends a prestigious fairy school, where she meets up with 4 other fiaries and forms the Winx.</p>
